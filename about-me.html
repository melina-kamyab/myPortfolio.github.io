          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there, my name is Melina and I'm currently a front-end develper student at Medieinsitutet. I find
            programming fun since I get to be creative  and go bananas
            with my designs. One day I will make my cray-cray ideas a reality.
          </p>

        <h2>Top 3 things that I'm great at:</h2>

        <h3>1. Managment</h3>
        <p>I have a masters degree in management and started my own business together with my mnother by the age of 20. Of course there is much more to learn and I'm eager to acquire even more knowledge within this field in the future!</p>

        <h3>2. Coding</h3>
        <p>Okay... Maybe not just yet but I will get there and become one hell of a coder! Just give me two more years</p>

        <h3>3. interiordesign and decoration</h3>
        <p>A big part the reason why I have chosen to study this is because I just love to re-decorate and re-arrange all my home, at least once a month. My goal is to create a room that is nice and gentle for the mind and eyes to look at. I want to be able to make use of this creativity on a daily basis at work as well, which is why I'm very excited to dive into programming and all that it has to give!</p>
